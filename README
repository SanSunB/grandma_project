A personal project in python.

The program recieves an image and construct it from new approximate color squars.
The goal is to create a map of how to knit the picture. 

Version 1 - Basic logic. Divide the to squares, calculate teh avarege color in each square. Create small squares filled with the color
            we calculated, and constructing them into an image.
            I used - Numpy and ompencv.
            
Version 1 - Added angular interface.
            Load an image from local computer, display it. 
            Establish Rest API connection with flask in the python server, send from the angular client the image and perameters
            to be decoded proceesed. Send back a url to the pixeled image in the server and display it in he client.
