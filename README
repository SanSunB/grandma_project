A personal project in python.

The program recieves an image and construct it from new approximate color squars.
The goal is to create a map of how to knit the picture. 

Version 1 - Basic logic. Divide the to squares, calculate teh avarege color in each square. Create small squares filled with the color
            we calculated, and constructing them into an image.
            I used - Numpy and ompencv.
